      <p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br>
        Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, <br>
        deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases<br>
        for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.<br>

         First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's popularity became widespread with the first series <br>
        of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared <br>
        from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one[a] are set in the <br>
        Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's <br>
        friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares <br>
        quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.<br>

         Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known. By the 1990s there were <br>
        already over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions and publications featuring the detective,<br>
        and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history.<br>
        Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;<br>
        numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped <br>
        create the modern practice of fandom.[7] The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery <br>
        writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than <br>
        Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over <br>
        one hundred years.</p>
